serial read flow:
1. create variables of x,y,z,r with default values of where the robot currently is
2. read characters from serial in until newline
3. sets x,y,z,r according to what was fed in
4. calls runG(x,y,z,r); NOTE: Gfunc is not passed in, it just uses the value set in the outer scope


G00: Rapid positioning, moves to set position at MaxSpeed, not always a straight line

G01: Linearly interpolate fron current position to set position

G02: CW circular interpolation
Set point is the center of the circle
1. moves distance r on y-axis at MaxSpeed
2. linearly interpolates from one point on the circle to the next in increments of 1 degree
3. moves back to center of circle at MaxSpeed

G03: CCW circular interpolation

G28: home. NOTE: homing is done at max speed, so any commands after homing will also take place at max speed if speed is not explicitly set



M00: does nothing????

M30: also does nothing????

M02: does nothing........

M03: turn on rotor in the "forward" direction
Pin LPWM is set to 0, RPWM is set to give PWM signal corresponding to RotorSpeed

M04: turn on rotor in the "backward" direction

M05: motor off
