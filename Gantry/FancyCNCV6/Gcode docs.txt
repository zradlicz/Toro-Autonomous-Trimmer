V6

G00 and G01: Linearly interpolate fron current position to set position

G28: home.

G30: move downward in z-axis until probe is in direct contact with the ground

M03: turn on rotor in the "forward" direction
Pin LPWM is set to 0, RPWM is set to give PWM signal corresponding to RotorSpeed

M04: turn on rotor in the "backward" direction

M05: motor off

S<int>: Sets motor speed as a PWM pulse, range from 0-255

F<int>: Sets feedrate (aka. movement speed) per axis. If moving at non-constant speed is allowed, this sets the max speed. Range from 0 to 50 mm/sec, and values above 50 if you change ABSOLUTEMAXSPEED in the arduino code.

R00: Stop recording data.

R01: Restart recording data. (starts recording from 0)

R02: Continue recording data.

NOTE: all print commands happen AFTER all previous gcode received has finished executing. Sending P00 while it is moving will not give you the gantry position at the time the command was sent.
P00: Print the gantry's current position.

P01: Print "report\n"

P<int>: for integers not already given a specific print statement, prints back the integer as "<int>\n"

????: sending any unrecognized string should prompt the arduino to reply with "waiting\n" if it is waiting for a new gcode command. sending just "?" doesn't do anything special.
