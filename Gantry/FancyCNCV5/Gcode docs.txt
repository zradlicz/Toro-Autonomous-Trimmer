V5

G00 and G01: Linearly interpolate fron current position to set position

G28: home. NOTE: homing is done at max speed, so any commands after homing will also take place at max speed if speed is not explicitly set

M03: turn on rotor in the "forward" direction
Pin LPWM is set to 0, RPWM is set to give PWM signal corresponding to RotorSpeed

M04: turn on rotor in the "backward" direction

M05: motor off

S<int>: Sets motor speed as a PWM pulse, range from 0-255

F<int>: Sets feedrate (aka. movement speed) per axis. If moving at non-constant speed is allowed, this sets the max speed. Range from 0 to 50 mm/sec, and values above 50 if you disable some of the arduino code.

?: if you send a question mark, the arduino should reply with "waiting\n" if it is waiting for a new gcode command.
